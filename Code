#Build Payload
Now, we will be creating a dataframe of the top 10 countries that search for the term “CLOUD COMPUTING“. For this, we will be using the method build_payload, which allows storing a list of keywords that you want to search. In this, you can also specify the timeframe and the category to query the data from. 

kw_list=["Cloud Computing"]
Trending_topics.build_payload(kw_list,cat=0, timeframe='today 12-m')
time.sleep(5) # Wait for 5 seconds

#Interest Over Time
The interest_over_time() method, returns the historical, indexed data for when the specified keyword was most searched according to the timeframe mentioned in the build payload method.
data = Trending_topics.interest_over_time()
data = data.sort_values(by="Cloud Computing", ascending = False)
data = data.head(10)
print(data)

#Historical Hour Interest
The get_historical_interest() method returns the historical, indexed, hourly data for when the specified keyword was most searched. You can also mention various time period parameters for which you want the historical data such as year_start, month_start, day_start, hour_start, year_end, month_end, day_end, and hour_end. 
kw_list = ["Cloud Computing"]
Trending_topics.build_payload(kw_list, cat=0, timeframe='2018-01-01 2018-02-01', geo='', gprop='')
data = Trending_topics.interest_over_time()
data = data.sort_values(by="Cloud Computing", ascending = False)
data = data.head(10)
print(data)
#Interest By Region
Next is the interest_by_region method, this will let you know the performance of the keyword per region. It will show results on a scale of 0-100, where 100 indicates the country with the most search and 0 indicates with least search or not enough data. 
data = Trending_topics.interest_by_region()
data = data.sort_values(by="Cloud Computing", 
                        ascending = False)
data = data.head(10)
print(data)
#Next, we can visualize the above data using a bar chart.
